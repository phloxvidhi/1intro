        <div class="text"></div><p> <b>Phlox Vanessa </b> (purple butterfly),is an identity I want to create, for me to work under. May it be <br>
             as a freelancer,or my startup under this name or be it just the name of my instagram & behance.
        </p></div>

     <ul> <h2>The reason for colour being purple</h2></ul>
    <li>Purple is my faviorate colour, and so are all the sades/tints of it.</li>
    <li>I assume that as it a mixture of red & blue, It signifies thier key qualites</li>
    <li>According to me, I think it nulifies the sharpness of red & blue, and represents them in more subtle and soft manner.</li>
        

         <UL> <H2> The reason I choose vanessa (butterfly) </H2></UL>
         <li> In my eyes butterfly is the most beautiful & the most colourful little insect that exists.</li>
         <li>Butterfly signifies the pretty privlage it has over Moth, another insect that looks just like butterfly but it's not <br>
             colourful and is not that pretty as a butterfly</li>
        <li>Butterfly compliments flowers and thrives in nature</li>
        <li>Butterfly grabs attention of everyone.It distracts others just through its presence</li>
